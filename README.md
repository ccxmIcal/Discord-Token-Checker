# Discord-Token-Checker

Add the tokens in the "tokens.txt" file. If you don't make the file yourself the software will make it for you automatically.
After that run it and the VALID tokens will be displayed as Valid and the ones that are invalid will be displayed as invalid.
It also has the option to choose if you want to save the valid tokens in a text file.
